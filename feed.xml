The current pace: rushing, with little room for technical excellence It’s no secret that building software has turned into a rush of code. What matters is having it running and shipping mo...</summary> </entry> <entry><title>AI &amp; Deep learning Introduction</title><link href="https://guihcodes.com/blog/posts/ai-introduction/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="AI &amp;amp; Deep learning Introduction" /><published>2025-04-24T08:25:00-03:00</published> <updated>2025-04-24T08:25:00-03:00</updated> <id>https://guihcodes.com/blog/posts/ai-introduction/</id> <content type="text/html" src="https://guihcodes.com/blog/posts/ai-introduction/" /> <author> <name>Guih Codes</name> </author> <category term="ai" /> <summary>What is AI? Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence by machines, especially computer systems. It enables machines to perform tasks such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, understanding language, and perceiving the environment. Brief History Deep learning Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that uses Artificial Neural Networks inspired by the human...</summary> </entry> </feed>
